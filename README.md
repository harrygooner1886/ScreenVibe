# 🎬 ScreenVibe

Discover what to watch, save it for later, and vibe with your screen time.

ScreenVibe is a React app that helps you decide what to watch when you sit down for a movie night.
You can search movies, build a personal watchlist, and mark them as watched — all with a sleek, Netflix-style interface.

# ✨ Features

🔍 Search movies using The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

🍿 Personal Watchlist — add, remove, and manage your movies.

✔️ Mark as Watched (coming soon).

🎨 Stylish UI with gradient branding, animated nav links, and custom favicon.

💾 LocalStorage persistence — your watchlist is saved between sessions.

⚡ Built with React + Vite for blazing fast dev and build.
